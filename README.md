### In which countries can I use Vipps MobilePay?
#### ![Vipps](./docs/images/vipps.png) Vipps
    🇳🇴 Norway
#### ![MobilePay](./docs/images/mp.png) MobilePay
    🇩🇰 Denmark
    🇫🇮 Finland

You can only get paid by users who have Vipps or MobilePay. At the moment Vipps is only available in Norway and MobilePay is available in Denmark and Finland.

### In which countries can I use MobilePay?

You can only get paid by users who have MobilePay. At the moment plugin is only supporting MobilePay users in Finland. Support for MobilePay in Denmark coming later in Q1 2024.

### For how long is an order reserved?

When a payment is completed with Vipps MobilePay, the money will be reserved, but only transferred to the merchant when the order is set to “Complete” or the money is captured manually. For MobilePay, this reservation period is 14 days, so you will need to ship and fulfill orders before this; or to make an agreement with the customer to capture the money before this period is over. For Vipps, the period is 180 days. For payments made by credit card in Vipps/MobilePay Checkout, the period can again be as short as 14 days.

If the order only contains virtual and downloadable products, its possible to setup a rule in Shopware where you can change the shipment status to "shipped" witch will capture the authorized amount. See how the Shopware rule builder works [here](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/settings/rules)
