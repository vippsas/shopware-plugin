### In which countries can I use MobilePay?

You can only get paid by users who have MobilePay in Finland and Denmark.


### For how long is an order reserved?

When a payment is completed with Vipps MobilePay, the money will be reserved, but only transferred to the merchant when the order is set to *Complete* or the money is captured manually. For MobilePay, this reservation period is 14 days, so you will need to ship and fulfill orders before this; or to make an agreement with the customer to capture the money before this period is over. For Vipps, the period is 180 days. For payments made by credit card in Vipps/MobilePay Checkout, the period can again be as short as 14 days.

If the order only contains virtual and downloadable products, it's possible to set up a rule in Shopware where you can change the shipment status to *shipped which will capture the authorized amount. See how the Shopware rule builder works on the [Shopware rule builder page](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/settings/rules)
